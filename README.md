# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Machine-Learning

We use the wine quality dataset available on Internet for free. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of several Machine learning models, we will predict the quality of the wine.

Importing libraries and Dataset:
Pandas is a useful library in data handling.
Numpy library used for working with arrays.
Seaborn/Matplotlib are used for data visualisation purpose.
Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.
